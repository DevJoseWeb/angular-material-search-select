# TODO first

* Multicolumn capability! Ideas:
  * Style the existing elements as a table?
  * Hide OptionEntry inside the component?
  * User provides a list of fields?

# TODO next

* Plunkr
* Example app demo online
* Settable width and height, maybe grab class via ViewChild and push in style
* Support swapping out the observable function live, without disturbing or
  breaking the component.
* Demo which cascades 3 of these components.

## TODO later

* E2E tests to verify behavior from a user PoV
* Demo that calls a backend service, json server
* Verify packaging and publishing to NPM really works
