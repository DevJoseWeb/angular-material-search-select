# TODO next

* Doc component

* Server side search demo - call backend service somewhere
  * MS Northwind API
  * https://github.com/StefH/angular-odata-es5
* Settings-fiddle page
* Demo which cascades 3 of these components
* Multicolumn capability! Ideas:
  * Style the existing elements as a table?
  * Hide OptionEntry inside the component?
  * User provides a list of fields?

# TODO later

* Expose way to customize the appearance
* Reconsider whether this should be just a value accessor, or replace all of
