# TODO next

* Doc component
* Blitz demo
* Prettier demo, use more Material
* Ditch json-server, not useful for a hosted static demo anyway
* Server side search demo
* Settings-fiddle page
* Demo which cascades 3 of these components
* Multicolumn capability! Ideas:
  * Style the existing elements as a table?
  * Hide OptionEntry inside the component?
  * User provides a list of fields?

# TODO later

* Expose way to customize the appearance
* Reconsider whether this should be just a value accessor, or replace all of
  angular material auto complete
* Settable width and height, maybe grab class via ViewChild and push in style
* E2E tests to verify behavior from a user PoV
* Demo that calls a backend service, json server
